This setup provides a comprehensive guide to automating the deployment of a simple web application using Docker, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and AWS for deployment. It also includes monitoring and logging using Prometheus and Grafana.
# DevOps Internship Assignment

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the automation of deploying a simple web application using a CI/CD pipeline. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed to AWS. Monitoring and logging are implemented using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Web Application

The web application consists of a Node.js backend and a React frontend.

### Backend

- `backend/package.json`
- `backend/index.js`

### Frontend

- `frontend/package.json`
- `frontend/src/App.js`

## Technologies Used

- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Cloud Service**: AWS
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus & Grafana

## Setup and Deployment

### Containerization

1. Create Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend.
2. Build and run Docker containers locally.

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file to automate the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Configure steps to build, test, push Docker images, and deploy to AWS.

### Deployment

1. Use Terraform to automate the deployment to AWS.
2. Define ECS cluster, task definition, and service.

### Monitoring and Logging

1. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the application.
2. Use Grafana to visualize the metrics.

## Bonus

- Auto-scaling and alerting can be added using AWS services.
- Kubernetes can be used for container orchestration.

## Deliverables

- [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/yourusername/devops-internship-assignment)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration files
- Infrastructure as code scripts
- Monitoring and logging configuration files
- README file with setup and deployment instructions

## Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness and correctness of the pipeline and deployment
- Proper use of Docker and cloud services
- Quality and comprehensiveness of the documentation
- Implementation of monitoring and logging
- Bonus: Auto-scaling, alerting, and Kubernetes usage
